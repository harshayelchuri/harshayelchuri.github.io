Hey there! I'm Harsha Yelchuri, a robotics researcher. I graduated with a B.E. in Information Science from R.V. College of Engineering.  After college, I jumped into research at the Indian Institute of Science. I worked on some pretty cool stuff like Robotics, Federated Learning, NLP, On-Device Learning, and TinyML. Currently, at RBCDSAI, I'm exploring the intersection of planning, control, and foundation models in robotics under the guidance of Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.

When I'm not busy with robots, you'll find me behind a camera or probably watching anime.
