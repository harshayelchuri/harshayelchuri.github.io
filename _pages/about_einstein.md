Hey there! I'm Harsha Yelchuri, a robotics researcher. I graduated with a B.E. in Information Science from R.V. College of Engineering.  After college, I jumped into research at the Indian Institute of Science. I worked on some pretty cool stuff like Robotics, Federated Learning, NLP, On-Device Learning, and TinyML. Currently, at RBCDSAI, I'm exploring the intersection of planning, control, and foundation models in robotics under the guidance of Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.

When I'm not busy with robots, you'll find me behind a camera or probably watching anime.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
