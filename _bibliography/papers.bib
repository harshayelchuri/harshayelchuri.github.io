  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {We describe a comprehensive methodology for developing user-voice personalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) models by effectively training models on mobile phones, allowing user data and models to be stored and used locally. To achieve this, we propose a resource-aware sub-model-based training approach that considers the RAM, and battery capabilities of mobile phones. By considering the evaluation metric and resource constraints of the mobile phones, we are able to perform efficient training and halt the process accordingly. To simulate real users, we use speakers with various accents. The entire on-device training and evaluation framework was then tested on various mobile phones across brands. We show that fine-tuning the models and selecting the right hyperparameter values is a trade-off between the lowest achievable performance metric, on-device training time, and memory consumption. Overall, our methodology offers a comprehensive solution for developing personalized ASR models while leveraging the capabilities of mobile phones, and balancing the need for accuracy with resource constraints.},
